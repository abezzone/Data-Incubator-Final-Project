# Data Incubator Final Project

## Airbnb Analysis
For my final project, I analyzed an open source Airbnb data set of 45,757 different listings from New York City. The data was collected on September, 2020  consisted of 4 different Airbnb room types within the 5 boroughs of New York City. While analyzing the data set, I wanted to predict whether an increase in host availability could increase the number of reviews an Airbnb got within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The feature of my proposed research question is Airbnb host availability and the label is the number of reviews. I performed a linear regression supervised model to determine the predictive relationship between host availability and number of reviews. The results did confirm my hypothesis that an increase in Airbnb host availability could lead to an increase in number of Airbnb reviews a listing receives. Through this prediction, Airbnb can identify which Airbnb types in the New York region would most likely attract potential customers based on the host availability and the increased number of reviews. The Airbnb Sales and Marketing team can market the various Airbnb types that have higher availability in hopes that the customer will rent out the properties due to the increased number of reviews.
